# Welcome to the Coding ðŸ‘‹

## Components:
Earlier 2 types of components - Functional, Class-based

Now components are also categorized by where they run - Client/Server [Introduced in React19]
By default they are ServerComponent.

## About NextJS
Server-side rendering helps in good SEO. \
No React-router package required. Now, React uses 'File-based routing'. \
'Automatic CodeSplitting' \
Image Optimizations - Compresses images, applies lazing loading, CDN support, etc. \
Script Optimization

## Routing
| URL Path: |            |            |

| app       | /dashboard | /settings  |

### 1. Route Groups
- Route Groups make code look organized, without affecting the URL.
- Route group is created with a directory enclosed in braces. eg. (root), (dashboard).
- Each Route-group has its own layout.tsx

NOTE: There CANNOT be multiple entrypoints (page.tsx files). Like both in (root) and (dashboard). \
In that case, following error will be shown on browser:
```
    Runtime Error
    Error: ./app/(root)
    You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path.
```
