# Welcome to the Coding ðŸ‘‹

## Components:
Earlier 2 types of components - Functional, Class-based

Now components are also categorized by where they run - Client/Server [Introduced in React19]
By default they are ServerComponent.

## About NextJS
Server-side rendering helps in good SEO. \
No React-router package required. Now, React uses 'File-based routing'. \
'Automatic CodeSplitting' \
Image Optimizations - Compresses images, applies lazing loading, CDN support, etc. \
Script Optimization

| "lint": "next lint"           | Runs ESLint for all files in the Source dir. |

## Routing
| URL Path: |            |            |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| acme.com  | /dashboard | /settings  | 
| app       | /dashboard | /settings  |

### 1. Route Groups
- Route Groups make code look organized, without affecting the URL.
- Route group is created with a directory enclosed in braces. eg. (root), (dashboard).
- Each Route-group has its own layout.tsx

NOTE: There CANNOT be multiple entrypoints (page.tsx files). Like both in (root) and (dashboard). \
In that case, following error will be shown on browser:
```
    Runtime Error
    Error: ./app/(root)
    You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path.
```

## Error Handling
- Only the closest error file  to the route takes priority
- Refer: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling

Boiler plate code for error.tsx:

```javascript
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components
 
import { useEffect } from 'react'
 
export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error(error)
  }, [error])
 
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button
        onClick={
          // Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
          () => reset()
        }
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Boiler plate code for global-error.tsx:
```js
'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components

import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function GlobalError({error,}: { error: Error & { digest?: string } }) {

    return (
        <html>
            <body>
                <h2>Global Error</h2>
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}

```
